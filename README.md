# Testudo++
A streamlined process for reviewing course and professor evaluations integrated as a browser extension on https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/. Further aims to resolve some consistent student concerns about resource availability during maintenence hours.

Future Implementations:
- Implement extension window interface
- Extension window logic; find way to toggle script injections
- In-screen course/professor reviews
- On-hover href dim
- Refactor: phase out DOM-timer delay, use promises?
