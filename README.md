A streamlined process for reviewing course and professor evaluations integrated as a browser extension on https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/
TODO

- *Random instances of "Extension context invalidated"
- Filter By is empty even for current professors (CMSC115) for unregistered course
    - I think this is fine, behavior is appropriate for situation
- Reviews container size adjustment?
    - Ask friends
