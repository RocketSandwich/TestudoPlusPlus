# Testudo++
A streamlined process for reviewing course and professor evaluations integrated as a browser extension on https://testudo.umd.edu/. Further aims to resolve some consistent student concerns about resource availability during maintenence hours.

Future Implementations:
- Review criteria (Filter By, Sort By)
- Extension window interface
- Phase out DOM-timer delay? (bug with occasionally unloaded links)
- Maintenance hours access
- Window size adjustment (too extra?)
- Minor pixel alignments
- Set link screen to invisible
- Sort drop-down by alphabetical
- BAD PLANETTERP API BOOOOOOOOO :(
